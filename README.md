# Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## Project description
I am a security professional at a large organization. Part of my job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. I recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines. My task is to examine the organizationâ€™s data in their **employees** and **log_in_attempts** tables. To do this, I'll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues. The following steps demonstrate how I used SQL filters to perform various security-related tasks.

## Retrieve after-hours failed login attempts
I recently discovered a potential security incident that occurred after business hours. To investigate this, I queried the **log_in_attempts** table to review after-hours login activity and used filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00.

In this example, I started by selecting all records from the **log_in_attempts** table. The line starting WHERE filters the results for records where a log-in attempt was made after 18:00, and the attempt was unsuccessful.

## Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. Any activity that occurred on this date, or the day before, needs to be investigated.

Here, I selected all information from the **employees** table, and applied a filter to ensure that only results from the dates specified were returned.

## Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
The team has now been asked to investigate any log-in attempts that did not originate in Mexico.

In my query, I start with a NOT filter, to make sure the query does not return records that meet the condition(s) established in the rest of the WHERE filter. The clause 'country LIKE 'MEX%' returns all records with countries that begin with 'MEX'. This is to make sure that records that contain 'MEX' or 'MEXICO' are returned.
